      Although the medical conditions may be posted with responses, our site should not be taken as a supplement for your physician’s opinion. You should contact your physician for medical decision making and advice on any symptoms, illnesses, or physical problems that may arise. The directions located in the app are not certifiably correct or used during correct medical assessments. This application is intended to be a guided questionnaire where the parent decides the severity of their child’s medical symptoms before taking the step to meet with their care provider or physician. Severity of illness diagnosis may be flexible based on the age of your child and your family’s health history. Please contact your care provider immediately if your child may be ill, contagious, or may have ingested poison. This app is for informational purposes only.
CALL 911 IF THERE IS AN EMERGENCY. Call your local DHEC center if you suspect your child to have been poisoned. 1 (800) 222-1222
